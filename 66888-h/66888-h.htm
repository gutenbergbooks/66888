<p>He didn&#8217;t belong to any patrol&mdash;he
wasn&#8217;t a real scout at all, but it wasn&#8217;t
Davy&#8217;s fault. He was only nine and a half,
you see, and that meant two years and six
months of waiting&mdash;oh, such long waiting it
seemed to Davy&mdash;before he could wear the
coveted arrow-head badge of the tenderfoot
scout and go hiking and camping like big
Cousin Fred.</p>

<p>That is how the figures stood late in
December. It was the summer before, at
Grandfather&#8217;s, that Davy had first begun
counting the time until he should be twelve.
There, at the farm, he had met Cousin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
Fred. Fred was sixteen years old, a first-class
scout, patrol leader in his home town, and
a winner of the life-saving merit badge.
But he had never felt too big to take Davy
for a Sunday hike over the hills, relating
thrilling tales of scout camp life and wood-craft;
telling all about scout law, with its
twelve hard things every scout must be and
the daily good turn every scout must do;
explaining the different badges, the oath, and
the salute. What wonder that Davy wanted
to be a scout most of anything in the world!</p>

<p>Shortly after his return in the autumn
Davy determined to take matters into his
own hands. Accordingly, one day, standing
before his looking-glass and raising his right
hand, palm to the front, he solemnly swore to
the oath, all by himself; then he pinned under
his jacket, right over his heart, a secret
badge of his own designing. There he had
worn it ever since, and considered himself as
honor-bound to the oath as any scout living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image009.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Standing before his looking-glass, Davy swore to the oath, by himself</i></p>

<p>It was now two days before Christmas.
There had been a snowstorm, clearing about
noon. Davy had hailed it with whoops of
delight. Now, by shoveling walks, he might
earn money to get a Christmas present for
Mother and Father, after all. It could not
be the magnificent azalea and real leather
pocketbook he had first dreamed of&mdash;that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
had been on the expectation of at least six
snowstorms; but there was a gay little
Jerusalem cherry tree for Mother, and for
Dad a beauty of a tie, red and green
changeable. Davy had selected them days
ago&mdash;all he was waiting for was a job.
What luck it should be Saturday and no
school!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image011.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>For one reason or another, nobody seemed to need Davy&#8217;s services</i></p>


<p>When the one o&#8217;clock whistle blew, Davy
and his snow shovel were well on their way,
bound for an attractive-looking corner house
out on the avenue&mdash;corner houses were
twice the job of ordinary places. Davy
pressed the bell button confidently. A sour-looking
maid opened the door an inch,
snapped out &#8220;No,&#8221; and banged it to before
Davy could get out a word. He stood
staring at the door for a moment, his mouth
still open, but a minute later he was striding
across the street to the opposite corner, once
more wearing his sturdy scout smile. There,
however, they kept a hired man; next door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
a big boy was already at work. For one
reason or another, nobody seemed to need
Davy&#8217;s services, and it began to look as if
Daddy and Mother might not get their
Christmas gifts at all; only, Davy was
determined. At last a nice little lady twinkled
&#8220;yes&#8221; over her spectacles. But Davy was
only on his third contract, with a shortage
of ten cents staring him in the face, when
the town clock struck four.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I declare, you work as if you
meant business!&#8221; A jolly old man paused
at Davy&#8217;s elbow. &#8220;Come up to number
seventy Lexington Avenue&mdash;electric light in
front&mdash;and I&#8217;ll give you a job. My pay
is thirty cents. If you aren&#8217;t there by a
quarter of five, I&#8217;ll take it you&#8217;ve struck
something nearer by and do it myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll be there, all right. Thank
you, sir!&#8221; Davy&#8217;s spirits rose to the crown
of his cap. The necktie and cherry tree were
in sight again&mdash;and a box of candy too.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image013.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Davy nearly ran down a young lady dashing along with a suitcase and<br />
an umbrella, in a frantic effort to overtake a passing trolley</i></p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later he was scuttling
out to Lexington Avenue. As he was crossing
the street, a block or two from the
railroad station, he nearly ran down a
young lady dashing along with a suitcase,
a handbag, and an umbrella, in a frantic
effort to overtake a passing trolley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>&#8220;Hey, there, hey!&#8221; yelled Davy, but
the car whizzed right along.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221; panted the young lady,
dropping her suit case. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lost it, and
there won&#8217;t be another Fletcher Avenue car
for fifteen minutes.&#8221; She looked as if about
to drop, herself, and Davy involuntarily
stretched out a small hand to steady her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;I do feel a
little shaky, running with this heavy luggage.
I believe I&#8217;ll go around the corner to the
drug store and get something hot&mdash;provided
I can secure a trusty young man to watch
my suitcase.&#8221; She smiled confidently down
into Davy&#8217;s honest face. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be back in
ten minutes, in time to catch the next car.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can trust me, <i>sure</i>!&#8221; Davy
smiled back. A scout has to be helpful and
courteous, especially to people in trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ll stay right here with it and
not let anyone touch it? It contains all
my Christmas presents, you see.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Davy promised with his hand over his
badge, but of course she couldn&#8217;t see that
away under his jacket!</p>

<p>He watched her anxiously as she crossed
the street and turned the corner. Then he
sat down on one end of the bag, his snow
shovel at his feet, and began to consider.</p>

<p>It was now twenty-two minutes after
four by the clock in the little tailor shop
at his left, and he must meet his appointment
at a quarter of five or lose his job.
Luckily, he had planned to get there ahead
of time&mdash;and she would be back in ten
minutes&mdash;so he&#8217;d keep his date all right.</p>

<p>Trinity chimes pealed the half-hour.
Eight minutes gone, and she hadn&#8217;t returned.</p>

<p>Now in the distance appeared a Fletcher
Avenue car&mdash;<i>her</i> car, that she would surely be
back to take! It approached, passed&mdash;and
she hadn&#8217;t come. Something must have happened!
If he could only go around the corner
and find out&mdash;but there was his promise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>Another five minutes gone&mdash;why didn&#8217;t
she come? He might still make it if he ran.</p>

<p>The chimes rang out a quarter of five!
It was all up now about the job, and he
was still ten cents short on his Christmas
fund, for he could not take a tip from the
lady&mdash;a scout may never accept pay for
a good turn. A chill wind was coming up,
and it was growing darker and darker on
the lonely corner. Davy stood up and
stamped his feet to get out the numbness.
But a scout has to be cheerful, no matter
<i>what</i>, and he tried to whistle.</p>

<p>The town clock struck five. The little
tailor came out of his little shop, rattled his
big key in his door, and was gone, leaving
Davy lonesomer than ever. He brushed his
eyes with his coat sleeve. A scout cry?
Never! But he was so cold and lonesome
and disappointed about the job! He hadn&#8217;t
thought that being a scout would be just
like this.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Then suddenly, clearer than the chimes,
he seemed to hear Cousin Fred&#8217;s cheerful
voice again, reciting their favorite passage
from the law: &#8220;<i>A scout is brave. He has
the courage to face danger in spite of fear.</i>&#8221;
And Davy knew, for sure, that he wasn&#8217;t
going to desert his post, no, not even if it
meant an all-night watch! He turned up
his coat collar and with better success started
whistling again, keeping time with his toes as
he paced up and down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, pard, waitin&#8217; fer yer airship?&#8221;
A burly young tough whom Davy had
noticed hanging around the opposite corner
swaggered up with a cigarette in his mouth.
&#8220;What yer got there? Nuggets or bombs?&#8221;
giving the suitcase a kick. &#8220;Aw, say,&#8221; he
added, with a crafty smile, &#8220;I&#8217;ll mind it
whilst yer beat it to Jakey&#8217;s fer a bag o&#8217;
peanuts,&#8221; and he held out a nickel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image018.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Davy turned up his coat collar and started whistling</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Oh, no, thank you.&#8221; Davy sat down
on the suitcase in a hurry. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
think of leaving it to anyone, not even somebody
I know. I promised her, you see&mdash;the
young lady&mdash;to keep it till she came back.
It&#8217;s got all her Christmas presents in it!&#8221;
Davy added proudly.</p>

<p>The ruffian&#8217;s eyes narrowed. He cunningly
changed his tactics. &#8220;Say, kid, what
did she look like&mdash;her that belongs to the
bag?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All kind o&#8217; brown clothes and pretty
and dreadful white in the face. Maybe
you&#8217;ve seen her?&#8221; wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do yer know!&#8221; Davy felt
his arm clutched tight. &#8220;Believe <i>me</i>, pard,
that young lady&#8217;s a pertic&#8217;ler friend o&#8217;
mine! And if you&#8217;ll jest remove yerself
from her trunk there, I&#8217;ll be <i>dee</i>-lighted to
fetch it to her. Here, I&#8217;ll stand fer her
tip,&#8221; trying to slip a coin into Davy&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir!&#8221; Davy set his jaw fast and
plumped down his little body more protectingly
than ever over his charge.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>&#8220;Aw, yer won&#8217;t, won&#8217;t yer? We&#8217;ll
see,&#8221; sneered the ruffian, casting a furtive
glance to right and left.</p>

<p>In an agony Davy followed his glance,
but no help was in sight&mdash;save an approaching
trolley, and that probably wouldn&#8217;t
stop. Oh, if only some one <i>would</i> come,
or if he were only bigger, or had a magic
sling like that David of old! But no, all
unarmed he must meet <i>his</i> giant Goliath.
Was ever a true scout up against heavier
odds? Then, in his dire need, he seemed
to hear Cousin Fred&#8217;s voice again, &#8220;<i>A scout
has the courage ... to stand up for the right ... against
the threats of enemies ... and
defeat does not down him</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Davy braced himself for whatever might
come&mdash;and it came promptly. A sharp
wrench, a vicious punch, and the suitcase
was in the hands of the enemy, and Davy
flattened on the ground, well-nigh winded.
It was a black moment for the brave little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
scout. Everything lost&mdash;and what would
<i>she</i> think? And he had tried so hard!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image021.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;Aw, yer won&#8217;t, won&#8217;t yer? We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; sneered the ruffian</i></p>

<p>Then&mdash;Ah, the trusty snow shovel,
Davy&#8217;s ally that hadn&#8217;t been reckoned on.
<i>Trip-ity-rip!</i> Over it went the enemy with
an ugly growl, sprawling into the gutter!</p>

<p>And the car <i>had</i> stopped, depositing a
broad-shouldered young man who saw what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
had occurred and was now making rapid
strides toward Davy. The ruffian, scenting
trouble, picked himself up, and limped a
double-quick retreat through the shadow and
around the corner&mdash;with<i>out</i> the bag!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, here you are, standing by
your guns, just as she said you&#8217;d be!&#8221; The
young man was addressing Davy, who had
managed to get on his legs once more and
regain his charge. &#8220;Say, but you&#8217;re game
all right!&#8221; At the word of appreciation
and the comradely slap on his shoulder,
Davy suddenly didn&#8217;t mind any more about
the long waiting, losing the job, and having
the wind knocked out of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re looking pretty white about the
gills, though,&#8221; the big young man&#8217;s voice
was very kind. &#8220;Beastly long ten minutes,
wasn&#8217;t it? She didn&#8217;t count on fainting,
you see, and that sort of thing. She&#8217;s my
sister&mdash;teaches in the South&mdash;was going to
spring a surprise on the family by coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
home for the holidays. Here, I&#8217;ll take that
ark off your hands and start you homeward.
Your folks&#8217;ll be getting worried about you.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image023.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Ah, the trusty snow shovel, trip-ity-rip! Over it went the enemy</i></p>

<p>Oh, how Davy longed to accept the proffered
release! But no, &#8220;I&mdash;I&mdash;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; he
stammered. &#8220;I promised, and a scout has to
keep his word.&#8221; Oh, it was hard to say &#8220;no&#8221;
to this friendly young man. It took almost
more courage than fighting the ruffian.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a good one on me!&#8221; The
big young man turned away his face to save
Davy&#8217;s feelings. &#8220;A <i>scout</i>, did I hear you
say?&#8221; He was quite serious now. &#8220;But
you&#8217;re some way short of twelve?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, of course, Davy had to tell about
the secret badge, who he was, where he
lived, Cousin Fred, and the encounter with
the ruffian.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, give us your hand, brother
scout. You&#8217;re the real article, certificate or
no certificate!&#8221; Davy&#8217;s small, mittened
palm was taken in a mighty grip. &#8220;Now
stand on the suitcase and look here&#8221;&mdash;the
big young man opened his greatcoat&mdash;&#8220;on
my sleeve, can you see?&#8221; taking out a
pocket flashlight.</p>

<p>Davy saw. The badge of the scout
master&mdash;a sure guarantee of all that was
honorable and loyal, trustworthy and brave.
It was like the coming of the Prince in
fairy tales. Davy&#8217;s eyes glowed. Words<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
failed him, but off came his right red mitten
and three fingers were raised to his forehead
in reverent salute. Then he quietly slipped
from the suitcase, and, the weary watch
over at last, joyfully resigned his charge
into lawful hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;I say! you&#8217;re a dandy little scout,
just the kind I&#8217;m looking for. And if
only I were a magician, I&#8217;d hustle those
next three birthdays of yours along in no
time at all. But here&#8217;s your car&mdash;you&#8217;ll
hear from us later. Good-by!&#8221; And with
a parting slap for Davy and a nickel to
the conductor, the scout master was gone.</p>

<p>On Christmas morning there came a
package and a letter for Davy, both in
the same unfamiliar hand. The package
contained a most wonderful book, and the
letter read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Little Merry Scout</span>:</p>

<p>Yes, that is what I have named you, for where
would there have been any Merry Christmas for me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
but for your valiant defense of my precious bag! I
am so sorry for what you had to endure on my behalf,
but I am very happy to add to my acquaintance one
more person who can be trusted, whatever the cost
to him. Surely, never was a real, truly boy scout
more faithful to his oath than my little scout of the
secret order.</p>

<p>I hope you will enjoy the <i>Animal Book and Camp-Fire
Stories</i>, by Dan Beard, National Scout Commissioner,
which my brother and I are sending you as a
small token of our gratitude.</p>

<p>We are planning to see you very soon.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">Most cordially your friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Agatha Alden</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; gasped Davy, turning rapturously
from letter to book and back to
letter again. &#8220;But any scout would have
had to do it, wouldn&#8217;t he, Dad?&#8221;</p>

<p>Father, admiring his new Christmas tie
before the sideboard mirror, smiled down
into Davy&#8217;s earnest face reflected therein.
&#8220;I should certainly say he would, my son,&#8221;
he agreed, without hesitation. But the eyes
he turned to Mother, across the room, were
brimming over with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Our</i> little Merry Christmas Scout,&#8221;
softly responded Mother, who was tending
a gay little Jerusalem cherry tree at the
window. Sometimes there are bargains, you
know, the last thing before Christmas, and
so Davy&#8217;s ten-cent shortage didn&#8217;t matter,
after all!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LENDING THE BABY</h2>
</div>


<p>Lakeside Park was fairly a-blossom with
children that bright summer morning, babies
<i>and</i> babies&mdash;chubby little boys in clean
jaunty blouses, dainty little girls, fresher
than the posies as they skipped about in
their spick-and-span frocks&mdash;all safeguarded
by grown-ups.</p>

<p>Bumpity-bump! Nurses, big sisters, and
children turned out in a hurry to make
room for Tilda, of the tenement, and baby
Maggie in her brand-new coach. Tilda
nodded and smiled shyly at the other little
boys and girls as she pushed along the
gorgeous gocart, a present that very morning
from dear, freckled, carrot-headed Pete,
of the same crowded tenement. Pete had
made it his own self a-purpose for Maggie,
out of a nice soap box and a pair of old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
wheels taken in trade with the rag man.
And the red paint&mdash;the crowning glory of
it all&mdash;he had earned doing odd jobs for
Michael, the carpenter.</p>

<p>Wee Maggie, scrubbed to a polish, dimpled
and babbled as she rumbled along.
And what mattered to Tilda any longer the
hot mile of dusty city walk&mdash;the tiresome
journey from the tenement&mdash;now at last
she had reached her beloved park? Oh, the
cool, woodsy, sweet-smelling park! Here
you could see such lots of the blue sky
above the wavy trees and look as much as
you liked at brilliant beds of geraniums
and verbenas&mdash;so long as you didn&#8217;t pick
them. And here, down by the ripply
water, you could watch the whitest swans
gliding along so elegantly, but not too
superior to accept the bits of cake tossed
from the bank by their young admirers.</p>

<p>By and by Tilda turned into a secluded
path and came suddenly upon a lady seated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
all alone on a rustic bench. She was leaning
her head on one hand and paying not
a speck of attention to any of the beautiful
things about her, not even to Mr. Robin,
who was calling &#8220;cheer up&#8221; so insistently
from the tip-toppest twig of the neighboring
birch.</p>

<p>Deary me, what could be the matter?
Tilda halted for exactly one quarter of a
minute, then, dropping the cart handle, tiptoed
across the grass, and, gently nudging
the lady&#8217;s arm, whispered, &#8220;Are you sick,
missis?&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger started and glanced up,
very much surprised to find a small girl
in a faded, patched gingham gazing at her
with solicitous gray eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, child, I&#8217;m not ill, thank you!
What made you think&mdash;but who is that
little one in the wagon?&#8221; she asked with
a sudden show of interest, interrupting
herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image031.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Deary me, what could be the matter?</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s my baby.&#8221; Tilda grew
tall with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Your</i> baby!&#8221; The sad lady very nearly
smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t she grand?&#8221; Tilda shoved
the cart close up to the bench. &#8220;She&#8217;s
Maggie. Open your mouth, Maggie, and
show the missis your teeth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She <i>is</i> a dear baby,&#8221; agreed the lady
wistfully, patting Maggie&#8217;s little tow head
with tender fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve got one at home, too?&#8221;
ventured Tilda.</p>

<p>&#8220;N-no, not now.&#8221; The lady&#8217;s voice was,
oh, so sorry! A big lump came right up
into Tilda&#8217;s throat and tears had started
on their way when a happy idea sent them
straight back again.</p>

<p>In less than two shakes of a lambkin&#8217;s
tail she had snatched wee Maggie from the
gocart and landed her pat on the strange
lady&#8217;s lap.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image033.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The lady snuggled Maggie close and held out one hand to Tilda</i></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll lend you my baby, missis,&#8221; she
offered softly. &#8220;You can take her every day.
I&#8217;ll fetch her in the gocart and&#8221;&mdash;Tilda faltered,
then continued bravely&mdash;&#8220;you can make
b&#8217;lieve she&#8217;s yours and not ours at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, dear!&#8221; Really truly
smiles now chased away the lady&#8217;s tears.
She snuggled Maggie close and held out
one hand to Tilda.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>&#8220;Yes, indeed, I should like to borrow
wee Maggie often, and you, too, little
mother! You are better than the sunshine.
Come sit down here and tell me all about
yourself and baby.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stray passers-by smiled with friendly
interest at the odd trio seated there so
cozily on the park bench: cheery little Tilda
from the tenement in her faded blue gingham,
punctuating the conversation with
intermittent bobbings of her funny, homemade
Dutch cut; the beautiful young
woman known to society as a wealthy
banker&#8217;s wife&mdash;Tilda immediately had dubbed
her &#8220;Fairy Godmother&#8221;&mdash;in an immaculate
white costume; and wee, rosy Maggie
in a pink dotted calico cuddled between
them.</p>

<p>Fairy Godmother listened with a strange,
new awakening as Tilda, with glowing
eyes, went on to enumerate all her riches.
First, of course, there was Maggie, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
sweetest baby in the world, and dear
Mother, who worked so hard to provide
for them since Father&#8217;s death. Then there
were her precious day school and Sunday
school, the enchanted park&mdash;Tilda loved to
pretend it was full of fairies&mdash;and there
were Pete and the gocart, and now there
was Fairy Godmother herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tilda,&#8221; a light struggled bravely
through the mist in Fairy Godmother&#8217;s
eyes, &#8220;this is my own baby&#8217;s birthday&mdash;darling
little Anne, who was lent to us
for twelve happy months, then taken back
by the Father of us all. It was to this
same park nurse and I used to bring her,
and so I came here today to keep her
birthday. But your bright little selves
have shown me a better way. Yes, I&#8217;m
going to borrow you both and take you
to my home to help me change this day
from the saddest to the gladdest day of
all the year.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image036.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Shortly they were spinning along in the trolley, the gocart on the rear platform</i></p>

<p>Shortly they were spinning along in the
trolley, with the precious gocart on the rear
platform. And before Tilda had a chance to
really &#8220;come to,&#8221; Fairy Godmother was saying,
&#8220;Here we are.&#8221; The car stopped, the
jolly conductor helped them out, gocart and
all, and in a moment more Tilda found herself
entering the &#8220;stylishest&#8221; house she had
ever seen. She followed on tiptoe into the
grand hall, up the wide stairs, and stepped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
straight into fairyland. It wasn&#8217;t any dream
kind, either, that you wake up from right in
the most exciting place. Tilda made sure of
that by biting her finger hard&mdash;and it <i>hurt</i>.</p>

<p>Fairy Godmother deposited Maggie on
the lovely blue center of the loveliest-of-all
rugs&mdash;Tilda&#8217;s feet were loth to tread on any
of them. Then she touched a funny little
button, and, presto! it was just like Arabian
Nights, excepting it wasn&#8217;t one of the <i>genii</i>
that appeared&mdash;only a pretty, rosy-cheeked
woman, in the tiniest white cap and apron.
She stood in the doorway, looking so surprised
at the little strangers that Tilda became
suddenly conscious of the patches in her
gingham frock, and the places where there
<i>should</i> have been patches in her shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Norah,&#8221; reminded Fairy Godmother
gently, &#8220;this is little Anne&#8217;s birthday, and
these dear children have come to spend it
with me and help to make it glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, marm,&#8221; responded Norah. And<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
Tilda followed her glance to the life-sized
portrait of a wee blue-eyed baby as sweet&mdash;yes,
as Maggie herself. Fairy Godmother
had a little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Norah, who soon
left the room, turning as she went to send an
assuring smile to the now welcome visitors.</p>

<p>Then Tilda and Maggie went to a wonderful
concert&mdash;all the time staying just
where they were. Ladies and gentlemen they
couldn&#8217;t see at all came and sang to them,
and whole orchestras and bands, all from the
same mysterious little box, played music that
set delicious thrills shivering down Tilda&#8217;s
back, and her feet to beating time. Sousa&#8217;s
band had just finished &#8220;El Capitan&#8221; when
some sweet little chimes tinkled out in the hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, Tilda.&#8221; Fairy Godmother picked
up Maggie and led the way downstairs, out to
the honeysuckle porch overlooking the garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image039.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Tilda and Maggie went to a wonderful concert&mdash;all<br /> the time staying just
where they were</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>There, as if the fairies had been at
work, stood the dearest little table that
ever was, on land or sea, with rosebuds
in the middle and set for just three, with
little rosebud dishes. My! but that was a
party for any royal princess, cocoa with
a lovely white foam on top, tiny three-cornered
chicken sandwiches, ice cream and
strawberries&mdash;two plates if you wanted
them&mdash;frosted cake and candy besides, and
milk for Maggie from a real silver cup!
The only sorry part of it was baby Anne
could not be there, too, for her own birthday.
Probably heaven was just as nice,
though Tilda could scarcely believe it.</p>

<p>After the &#8220;party&#8221; Maggie was tucked up
cozily on the veranda couch for a nap, and
Tilda was escorted to the garden to meet
General Jack, Lady Gay, Baltimore Belles,
American Beauties, and other celebrities,
to say nothing of the pert little Pansy
folk, who turned up their saucy faces at her.
And Fairy Godmother said she might pick
all the roses she wanted, her own self.
Fancy it&mdash;dozens of them&mdash;red, white, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
pink, like the grandest lady of the land! And
every now and then, as Tilda stole a shy
glance at Fairy Godmother&#8217;s glad face, her
own beamed brighter than ever.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image041.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Fairy Godmother said she might pick all the roses she wanted</i></p>

<p>An hour flew by as hours only can in
Fairyland gardens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honk, honk!&#8221; Tilda jumped to one
side quicker than pop, it sounded so near,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
and Fairy Godmother, standing on the
porch with wide-awake Maggie in her arms,
laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is talking to us, Tilda,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;and says, &#8216;Come out front.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>There by the curb stood a splendid great,
shiny auto, waiting for Tilda and Maggie.</p>

<p>Out from the front seat hopped a nice
big man with a nice big smile to match,
to help them all in and get them settled.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is &#8216;Fairy Godfather,&#8217; Tilda,&#8221; introduced
Fairy Godmother. &#8220;He&#8217;s heard all
about you and Maggie over the &#8217;phone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted to meet you, Miss Tilda
and Maggie,&#8221; he said in a nice big voice
as he held out his hand, and Tilda felt
almost too magnificent to live.</p>

<p>Norah now came flying out with a mysterious
box, which she handed right over
to Tilda. Then Fairy Godfather packed in
the gocart and away they whizzed for the
tenement&mdash;by way of the shore.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Two hours later, when tired Mother
came home from her long day&#8217;s work, a
radiant and breathless Tilda met her at
the door and invited her to a royal spread.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do have some more cake and another
cup of tea,&#8221; insisted the little hostess gayly.
&#8220;And just think, Mother, a trip to the
country for all of us for two whole weeks!
Isn&#8217;t it grand? And there&#8217;ll be cows and
chickens and green grass and flowers, and
the rent paid all the while we&#8217;re gone!
But most the wonderfulest part of it all&#8221;&mdash;Tilda&#8217;s
eyes grew starry&mdash;&#8220;was how Fairy
Godmother kept getting gladder &#8217;n&#8217; gladder
all the time. And she said &#8216;thank you&#8217; to
me, Mother, and Fairy Godfather did, too,
&#8217;s if <i>I&#8217;d</i> done anything, when you know
positive sure I never did one single thing
&#8217;cept lending Maggie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure about that, dear.&#8221;
And Mother patted the scraggly Dutch cut
tenderly, smiling into Tilda&#8217;s questioning eyes.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">ROBERT&#8217;S ADVENTURE</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;Good-by, Robert,&#8221; called Mother, as
she and Father drove off for the city one
summer afternoon. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to fill the
wood box, dear, and to feed the chickens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; answered the boy from the
stone wall, without looking up.</p>

<p>Robert was discontented. He was tired
of filling the wood box and feeding the
chickens every day, and for only five cents
a week. Five cents a week! Yes, that was
all he had to spend for candy, marbles, and
everything, while Timmie Marsh, who lived
down the road, had a nickel about every
day, and he never had to work at all.</p>

<p>Robert had been thinking and thinking
what could be done about it, and at last
he had made up his mind. He would go
to Blakeville that very afternoon to old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
Nurse Tucker&#8217;s. He could walk four miles
easily, and Nurse would be so glad to see
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; he said to himself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll
write to Mother, so she&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m not
drowned or anything. And I&#8217;ll tell her how
Nurse gives me five cents for candy every
day&mdash;&#8217;course she will&mdash;and how I don&#8217;t
have to do any work, either. Then won&#8217;t
Daddy come for me quick and say if I&#8217;ll
only go back with him, I needn&#8217;t bring in
the wood or feed the chickens or do anything
unless I feel like it, and I can have
all the money I want, besides!&#8221;</p>

<p>And now, as the buckboard vanished
in the distance, Robert turned toward the
house to carry out his plan. He could hear
Mandy, the hired girl, singing at her work
as he tiptoed cautiously in at the wood-shed
door and up to his room.</p>

<p>After giving his hair one hasty stroke
with the brush and putting on his Sunday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
shoes and stockings, he considered his toilet
completed and was soon stealing out of the
wood shed again, unobserved by Mandy.</p>

<p>A moment later Robert was skulking
through the barnyard, making a bee line for
the blueberry lot and the turnpike. But
what made the chickens act so queerly?
Mrs. Bantam, with her head cocked on one
side, eyed him suspiciously as he crept along,
while the great white rooster flew upon the
coop and screamed right out, so loud that
Robert feared the whole village would hear.
&#8220;<i>What-you-going-to-do-oo? What-you-going-to-do-oo?</i>&#8221;
Robert did not think best to answer,
but was only more eager than ever to move
on his journey.</p>

<p>He had no sooner struck the blueberry
lot, however, than Lady Ann, the Jersey cow,
started for him, and, poking out her head,
exclaimed in mild surprise, &#8220;<i>Oo-oo! oo-oo!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span></p>
<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image047.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>What-you-going-to-do-oo? What-you-going-to-do-oo?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>And he had barely reached the road,
when, to cap the climax, the sheep from
the stony pasture across the way began to
chide him. &#8220;<i>Ba-ad! Ba-ad!</i>&#8221; they bleated.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m <i>not</i> bad, either!&#8221; cried Robert
almost in tears. Here he had gone cross-lots
purposely to escape the villagers and
now the animals were all after him! And,
stuffing his fingers in his ears, he began to run.</p>

<p>The summer sun was blazing; still Robert
kept on, though with ever-slackening speed,
meeting no one but a stray dog or two
and an occasional ox-team with its sleepy
driver. At length he came to a big sign
post which read:</p>

<p class="center">BLAKEVILLE 3 MILES</p>

<p>&#8220;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps I&#8217;d better sit down a minute,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;m not tired, of course,
and my shoes don&#8217;t hurt&mdash;only just a little
bit. I guess there won&#8217;t be anybody to catch
me &#8217;way out here.&#8221; And as he sat rubbing
his hands over the shoes that did not hurt,
he encouraged himself with visions of the
candy counter at Nurse&#8217;s village store.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>&#8220;Why, Robert, little man, what are you
doing so far from home?&#8221; There was no
escaping an answer this time, for it was
Mrs. Bronson, the minister&#8217;s wife, who stood
before him.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&mdash;er, I&#8217;m&mdash;er going for a walk, Mrs.
Bronson,&#8221; he stammered, jumping up; and,
taking off his cap, he turned on his heel
and started on again, never once daring to
look behind.</p>

<p>But the Sunday shoes were soon pinching
in good earnest. He could stand them
no longer, so he pulled them off, and, swinging
them on his shoulder, went on in his
stocking feet.</p>

<p>Uphill and downhill he trudged. How
hot the sun was! And how tired and bruised
his poor feet were getting!</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I&#8217;ll take another little rest,&#8221;
he said as he limped across the road. &#8220;It&#8217;s
nice and shady here by the brook and I <i>am
some</i> tired.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>Down upon the sweet green grass he
lay. The candy counter at Blakeville was
beginning to lose its charm, and&mdash;</p>

<p>Robert sat up in a sudden fright. A
solemn voice was calling to him from the
woods: &#8220;<i>Bubby-gu-hum! Bubby-gu-hum!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert turned fearfully, and there, on a
stone in the brook, sat a great, blinking frog.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go home, you naughty frog!&#8221;
he cried. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to Nurse&#8217;s.&#8221; Then,
ka-splash! and Mr. Frog had disappeared.</p>

<p>There was a queer buzzing in Robert&#8217;s
head, and presently he was fast asleep in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>The sun set. The little boy slept on.
A cool breeze came up, and Robert tried
to pull the bedclothes over him, but there
weren&#8217;t any clothes to pull&mdash;and he awoke.</p>

<p>He sat up and looked around. What
could it all mean? When finally it dawned
upon him where he was, he set up a wail
and then stood in bewilderment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image051.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>&#8220;I won&#8217;t go home, you naughty frog,&#8221; Robert cried</i></p>

<p>In a moment he started in fresh horror,
hearing wheels close at hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Supposing it&#8217;s gypsies,&#8221; he groaned,
&#8220;and they should carry me off! Oh dear!
Oh dear!&#8221;</p>

<p>Nearer came the wheels. There was no
way of escape. All he could do was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
drop down beside the road and keep so still
maybe they&#8217;d think he was a log of wood.</p>

<p>Now he heard voices. There might be
twenty of them. Twenty gypsies! Could
it be they were going by without noticing
him? Robert hardly dared to breathe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whoa there! What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>

<p>A big man leaped from the team. Robert
closed his eyes and tried to pray. But all
that he could think of was, &#8220;Now I lay
me,&#8221; and that would never do.</p>

<p>A lantern was flashed in his face.
&#8220;Bless my stars, if it isn&#8217;t our own Robert!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O Daddy, Daddy!&#8221; sobbed a frightened
little voice.</p>

<p>Two strong arms lifted the shivering
little fellow and placed him in the buckboard
right beside his own mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert, Robert!&#8221; she cried tremulously.
&#8220;How did you ever get way out
here at this time of night?&mdash;and in your
stocking feet!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image053.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;<i>Oh, Mother, I want to go home, and I&#8217;ll bring in the wood,<br />
and feed the chickens</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mother, I was g-going to Nurse&#8217;s
and my shoes hurt and I went to sleep, but
I don&#8217;t want to go there any m-more. I
want to go ho-home, and I&#8217;ll bring in the
wood, and f-feed the chickens every day,
and you needn&#8217;t give me any m-money
at all!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Then Mother, who was a wonderful
magician, understood all about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she cried softly, &#8220;supposing we
had gone home by the other road!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Father said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s see. It isn&#8217;t
too late yet. Shan&#8217;t we turn around and
carry him to Blakeville?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, no!&#8221; pleaded Robert, clutching
his father&#8217;s arm, &#8220;I want to go <i>ho-ome</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! you&#8217;ve really changed your
mind then, have you? Well if that&#8217;s the
case, we&#8217;ll jog right along. Get up, Daisy.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Robert, snuggled there up against
Mother, so safe and warm, at that moment
would not have changed places with any
boy living; no, not even for all the candy
in the Blakeville store!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SANDY&#8217;S VALENTINE</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s Valentine&#8217;s Day, Jeanie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Sandy, I know.&#8221; Jeanie turned
gently to the little brother, whose face was
all swollen with mumps.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say, Jeanie, wouldn&#8217;t it be nice to
have a truly valentine with lace and angels
on it, like what&#8217;s in the store windows?
Do you &#8217;spose I will get one tomorrow?&#8221;
he asked wistfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you will, Sandy.&#8221; Jeanie
smiled bravely, but her heart ached for the
disappointment she feared was in store for
him. How she was longing for a &#8220;truly&#8221;
valentine herself, she did not breathe to
Sandy.</p>

<p>There were many things that sadly
puzzled seven-year-old Jeanie. Why should
Father have gone to heaven to stay forever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
when they all needed him so badly? Why
did the rent man come so often to take
all Mother&#8217;s money as fast as she saved it?
Why did the grocer never bring a turkey to
their house on Thanksgiving or Christmas?
And why did the postman never stop at their
door, even on holidays, when he had so many
packages? It seemed as if one, at least,
must certainly be meant for them.</p>

<p>Jeanie was turning it all over in her
mind now, as she made Sandy&#8217;s bed, this
morning before Valentine&#8217;s Day, when suddenly
a bright idea came into her head, and,
darting across the room to a rickety little
table, she opened the drawer and pulled out
a piece of druggists&#8217; white paper. Smoothing
it out on the table, she folded the two
short edges carefully together.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks just like boughten letter paper
now, don&#8217;t it, Sandy? But you mustn&#8217;t ask
a single question, because it&#8217;s a surprise,&#8221;
she said, settling herself to write. Then for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
thirty long minutes, Jeanie&#8217;s stub pencil
crawled painfully over the white surface.
It was a hard task for her, especially as
Mother wasn&#8217;t at home to help with the
spelling.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image057.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Jeanie was turning it all over in her mind as she made Sandy&#8217;s bed</i></p>

<p>At last Jeanie heaved a deep sigh of
relief. &#8220;There,&#8221; she said aloud, &#8220;it&#8217;s all ready
now but the unvelope.&#8221; Whereupon she took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
from the family Bible a treasured envelope
she had picked up in the street one day.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a perfectly good unvelope, all
unstuck same&#8217;s a new one,&#8221; she said to herself
&#8220;and a nice green stamp on it. All the
matter is, it&#8217;s wrote on a little, but I can
scratch that out all right.&#8221; And soon the
second-hand envelope was ready and the
letter tucked inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must go to school now, Sandy!&#8221;
cried Jeanie, running for her coat and hat.
&#8220;Mother&#8217;ll be home pretty soon. Good-by.&#8221;
In a moment she was out of the door and
hurrying to the mail box on the corner,
where, standing on tiptoe, she dropped in
the precious missive.</p>

<p>That noon, as Postman Green sat at
dinner with his wife, he suddenly exclaimed,
&#8220;Oh, I &#8217;most forgot my valentine!&#8221; and
he pulled from his pocket a sorry-looking
envelope, directed to &#8220;Mister Postman himself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image059.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>Jeanie, standing on tiptoe, dropped in the precious missive</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;From one of my young admirers on
Gregory Street,&#8221; he laughed, passing it to
his wife.</p>

<p>Mrs. Green tore it open. &#8220;Why, it&#8217;s a
letter,&#8221; she said, proceeding to read aloud:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Postman</span>:</p>

<p>I thort I wood rite you about Sandy&#8217;s valuntin;
he wants one orful&mdash;one of those kind with lace and
angels on it what come in unvelops. He has got the
mumps and can&#8217;t go out, and Mother ain&#8217;t got any
money to buy a valuntin, and father has been in
heaven a long time. Won&#8217;t you plees look everywhere
around the post-orfice, and in all the boxes on the
lamp-posts, and see if you can&#8217;t find one for him?
His name is Sandy Keith, and we live in the little
brown house, number 27 Gregory Street, wher you
don&#8217;t ever stop, even on Christmus. I will be looking
for you at the winder tomorer noon. Plees don&#8217;t go
by or cross the street this time.</p>

<p>From your frend,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Jeanie Keith</span></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Poor little things! They mustn&#8217;t be
disappointed!&#8221; cried Mrs. Green.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, they shan&#8217;t be,&#8221; answered the
postman soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve just thought up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the nicest little scheme. I&#8217;ll tell you how
it all comes out tomorrow.&#8221;</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/image061.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><i>The door was opened by a pale-faced little girl, leaning on a crutch</i></p>

<p>Late that afternoon Postman Green rang
the bell of a fine stone house on Hillside
Avenue. The door was opened quickly by
a pale-faced little girl, leaning on a crutch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only five of them for you in this
mail,&#8221; laughed the postman, as she held out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
her hand, &#8220;but here&#8217;s a valentine <i>I</i> got this
morning I&#8217;d like you to see. I&#8217;ll call for
it tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little rich girl!&#8221; he said to himself,
as he went away. &#8220;She&#8217;ll have something
new to amuse her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The next noon Jeanie came home from
school in a quiver of excitement. Sandy
met her with a rueful face. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t come,
Jeanie,&#8221; he cried reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;But Valentine&#8217;s Day isn&#8217;t over yet,&#8221;
laughed Jeanie gaily. And, dinner dispatched
as soon as possible, she took her
stand at the window.</p>

<p>At that moment, several blocks away,
the postman was again stopping at the door
of the great stone house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad that you showed me your
valentine,&#8221; the little girl on the crutch was
saying, with sparkling eyes, &#8220;else I&#8217;d never
have known anything about them. Thank
you so much. It&#8217;s the best fun I ever had.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>It seemed a long time to Jeanie,
stationed at the window, before the familiar
blue coat came in sight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, here he comes, Sandy!&#8221; she cried
at last, clasping her hands tightly together,
&#8220;and he sees me, and he&#8217;s waving something
white!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jeanie flew to the door and opened it
before the postman had time to ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;For Master Sandy Keith,&#8221; he announced,
holding out a great white envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him, that&#8217;s him!&#8221; cried Jeanie
wildly, pointing to Sandy, who, regardless of
mumps, had followed her. &#8220;Oh, thank you,
Mister Postman! I knew you&#8217;d come. But
where did you ever find such a big one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For Miss Jeanie Keith,&#8221; continued the
postman, not seeming to hear, taking from
his pack another envelope as big as the first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, that&#8217;s me!&#8221; Jeanie caught her
breath. &#8220;And I wanted one awful. But how
did you know?&#8221; The postman only smiled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>&#8220;By the way,&#8221; he said, as he turned
to go, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be stopping again before long.
There&#8217;s a Christmas box that ought to have
been left here nearly two months ago. I&#8217;m
real sorry I&#8217;ve neglected you all this while.&#8221;
Then he hurried off.</p>

<p>Such valentines were never seen in
Gregory Street before as were set up in the
window of number twenty-seven that day,
nor two such bright faces as peeped out
from behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you &#8217;spose there&#8217;s anybody in the
whole world as happy as we are, Sandy?&#8221;
Jeanie asked a dozen times over.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course not!&#8221; responded Sandy indignantly
each time.</p>

<p>But they did not know about the little
girl on a crutch in the fine stone house,
who was brimming over with joy that day
because she had adopted two little stranger
friends, to be their valentine the whole year
round.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
